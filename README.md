- [x] collinear
- [x] 8puzzle
- [ ] kdtree `kdtree` fix low performance issue

- [x] wordnet `worldnet` done, 94, need to implement a cache for SAP.java to further improve performance
- [x] seam carving but 62 when test online, probably edge daeling is differnt but this class fully functional on all the images.
